    <p style="color:black;">Penguins are flightless birds with flippers instead of wings. Their bodies are adapted for swimming and diving in the water, with some species able to reach speeds up to 15 miles per hour. Their body shape is fusiform (tapered at both ends) and streamlined, allowing them to be expert swimmers.</p>
